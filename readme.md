# Mobile Application Preliminary Security Reviews

This repository contains Preliminary Security Reviews for two vulnerable mobile applications: **AndroGoat** (Android) [GitHub](https://github.com/satishpatnayak/AndroGoat) and **iGoat-Swift** (iOS) [GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/iGoat-Swift). The analysis was conducted using the Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) and involves:

- Identifying the file hashes of both applications using MobSF.  
- Analyzing the reputation of these hashes using VirusTotal.  
- Extracting the AndroGoat database password with evidence provided.  
- Generating an iGoat-Swift report with insights for initiating a penetration test.
